# Explanation for: what is lisply

This is a brief, local fallback summary grounded in available DeepWiki data for `modelcontextprotocol/servers`.

## DeepWiki Answer (raw)
Lisply is identified as a "Flexible frontend for compliant Lisp-speaking backends" . It is listed as a third-party Model Context Protocol (MCP) server within the `modelcontextprotocol/servers` repository . This means that Lisply is an external integration that can interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) through the Model Context Protocol  .

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol that allows LLMs to securely interact with external tools, data sources, and services . It provides a structured interface between AI clients (like Claude Desktop, VS Code Extension, Zed Editor, or custom MCP clients) and server implementations .

## Lisply's Role in the MCP Ecosystem
As an MCP server, Lisply enables AI agents to interact with Lisp-speaking backends . This integration allows LLMs to leverage the capabilities of these backends for various tasks . The `modelcontextprotocol/servers` repository maintains a directory of such third-party MCP servers, including Lisply, in its `README.md` file  .

Notes:
The provided codebase context primarily lists Lisply as an entry in the `README.md` file, indicating its existence as a third-party MCP serv
