# Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol: A Report

## Overview

The Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol is an open standard [1, 2, 7] designed to enable communication and interoperability between AI agents built on diverse frameworks and by different vendors [2].  It aims to create a common language for agents, fostering a more interconnected and powerful AI ecosystem [1].  A2A is complementary to the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which focuses on connecting agents to tools and resources [2].

## What it is

A2A is an open-source protocol [1, 7] that allows AI agents to communicate and collaborate effectively [1].  It addresses the challenge of enabling interoperability between agents built using different frameworks and deployed on separate servers [1]. A2A focuses on agent-to-agent communication rather than agent-to-tool interactions handled by MCP [2].


## Why it matters

*   **Interoperability:** Connects agents from various platforms to create complex AI systems [2].
*   **Complex Workflows:** Enables agents to delegate tasks, share information, and coordinate actions for problem-solving beyond the capacity of individual agents [2].
*   **Security and Opacity:**  Allows agents to interact without exposing internal states, memory, or proprietary logic [1, 2].
*   **Open Standards:** Promotes community-driven development and broad adoption [1].


## How it works (high-level flow)

A2A uses a standardized communication method (JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP(S)) [1] to facilitate interactions between agents. Agents discover each other through "Agent Cards" [1], which describe their capabilities and connection information.  Communication can be synchronous, streaming, or asynchronous [1], handling various data types including text, files, and structured JSON data [1].


## Core Concepts

*   **Servers:**  Host AI agents and handle communication via the A2A protocol.
*   **Clients:**  Interact with A2A servers, potentially managing multiple agents and facilitating their interactions.
*   **Tools/Prompts/Resources:** While not directly managed by A2A, these are accessed by agents via protocols like MCP [2].  A2A facilitates the coordination of access and utilization of these resources among multiple agents.


## Current ecosystem & SDKs

A2A provides SDKs in Python, JavaScript, Java, and .NET [1], supporting various development environments. The protocol is actively developed and improved, with ongoing work on agent discovery, collaboration, task lifecycle management, and streaming reliability [1].  The project is open-source and hosted on GitHub [1], encouraging community contributions.


## Use Cases

*   Building complex, multi-agent AI systems that leverage the strengths of specialized agents [2].
*   Facilitating workflows where agents collaborate to solve problems that are too complex for a single agent [2].
*   Enabling secure interaction between AI agents from different organizations, preserving intellectual property [1, 2].


## Limitations & open questions

*   The protocol is relatively new, and its long-term adoption and impact on the AI landscape remain to be seen [7].
*   Scalability and performance under heavy load need further investigation.
*   Security aspects, particularly authentication and authorization, require continuous improvement and community scrutiny [1].
